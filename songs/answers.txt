If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    average valence is 0.48, energy is 0.65 and danceability is 0.71
    so their's audio aura is not sad or happy, on the energetic side and person likes to dance to his music

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    I also would take into account tempo of the songs, their loudness and speechiness
